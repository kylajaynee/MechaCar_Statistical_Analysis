# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Using R to help Jeremy with a special project from upper management. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
### Deliverables 
1.	Linear regression to predict mpg
2.	Summary statistics on suspension coils
3.	T Test on suspension coils
4.	Study comparing the MechaCar to the competition
