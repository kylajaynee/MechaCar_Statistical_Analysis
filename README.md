## MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
#### Module 16 Challenge
### Project Overview
Using R to finish a special project from upper management. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
### Deliverables
1.	Linear regression to predict mpg
2.	Summary statistics on suspension coils
3.	T Test on suspension coils
4.	Study comparing the MechaCar to the competition
#### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle length and vehicle weight are the two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The slope of this lineaar model is not
considered to be zero because the mpg varies greatly depending on physical characteristics. The linear model predicting mpg of MechaCar prototypes is effective because
mean and median are close to the same amount.
#### Summary Statistic on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The current
manufacturing data does not meet the design specificationfor all lot total and each individual lot.
#### T Test on Suspension Coils Summary

### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
To compare the MechaCar's performance against the competition we should analyze the cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, and safety
rating. This will allow consumers to make an informed decision on the purchase of their new vehicle and allow MechaCar to improve their performance to meet or exceed
that of the competition.
